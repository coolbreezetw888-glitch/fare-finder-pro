# Fare Finder Pro

Build a SaaS landing page + authenticated app shell for Flight Price Notifier(機票降價通知), a product that watches popular flight routes from Taipei and emails the user when the cheapest fare drops to or below their target price — targeted at budget-driven travelers who don't care exactly when they fly, they just want a ticket under their budget.

The site must include:

A public landing page (/) with:

Hero section: product name "Flight Price Notifier" prominently displayed, value prop「設定航線與目標價,機票降價就通知你」(subtitle: "Set a route and a target price — we email you when the fare drops."), and a primary CTA button labeled "Sign in / 登入" in the top-right header.

Features section with exactly 3 feature cards:

Card 1:「盯緊熱門航線(Always-on route watching)」— 持續監控台北出發的熱門航線(東京、首爾),自動抓最低票價。

Card 2:「達標自動通知(Target-price alert emails)」— 低於你設定的目標價,就會 email 提醒你,附上立即訂購連結。

Card 3:「隨時取消(Cancel anytime)」— 月訂閱制,不想用隨時停,沒綁約。

Modern, professional dark theme (purple/violet accent on a near-black background)

Use Inter or a similar sans-serif font

Mobile responsive

Tasteful subtle animations (fade-in on scroll is fine; don't overdo it)

Out of scope for this v1: route-subscription form, target-price input, fare display, payment, custom database tables (do NOT create a subscriptions or profiles table — only use Supabase's default auth.users). Those come in later milestones. Stick to landing page + auth + placeholder dashboard.
